ChatFXT is a simple yet powerful AI chatbot service ü§ñ, built with Next.js and integrated with the API from [NULLAIServerAPI](https://github.com/NULLCommand1/NULLAIServerAPI). The chatbot's interface is developed based on a template whose origin is no longer credited. ChatFXT can quickly respond ‚ö° to individual user-provided questions, with each response being completely independent and unaffected by data from previous questions. The application is designed as a visual demo tool for deploying the API from NULLAIServerAPI, providing a simple yet effective experience.

## Usage

Visit the ChatFXT website [here](https://chatfxt.vercel.app/) üåê, then enter your question into the chat box and press Enter to send. The chatbot will respond to your question immediately. Each question and answer are completely independent of each other, not influenced by data from previous questions, do not store data, and do not have learning capabilities.
